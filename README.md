# WebcamWinForm
A simple Windows Form application to demonstrate how to record video and audio via a Logitech webcam using C#.

## Objective
Inspired by ["How to use a web cam in C# with .NET Framework 4.0 and Microsoft Expression Encoder 4", a project on Code Project by Italian software developer Massimo Conti](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/202464/How-to-use-a-WebCam-in-C-with-the-NET-Framework), I built a simple demo to show how we can connect C# Windows Form with [Logitech HD Webcam C525](http://www.logitech.com/en-hk/product/hd-webcam-c525) to record both video and audio.
